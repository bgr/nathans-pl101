Continuation passing and thunks
===============================

This homework project demonstrates converting a recursive function into continuation passing style and thunks. The function I chose is __Towers of Hanoi__ solver. Turns out that regular version I wrote doesn't have problem with stack size, which would be convenient for demonstration purposes, but I didn't want to rewrite it since CPS version does, and it is demonstrated that thunked version gets rid of the problem.

It wouldn't be fair not to throw in a [fancy demo page][page] too.
