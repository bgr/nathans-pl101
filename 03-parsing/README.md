MUS and Scheem parsing
======================

This homework project covers parsing the MUS and Scheem code. Scheem is a bare bones version of Scheme programming language, and MUS is my made up nonsensical musical notation with support for sections that repeat and play in parallel.

To see the whole deal in action check out the [project pages](http://bgr.github.com/nathans-pl101).

Parsers are defined in .pegjs files which are used by [peg.js](http://pegjs.majda.cz) parser generator.

Tests are using [nodeunit](https://github.com/caolan/nodeunit).
